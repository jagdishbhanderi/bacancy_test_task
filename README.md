== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

I have used "HackerNews API: http://api.ihackernews.com/" for this task.

Dependencies:

* Ruby on Rails(ruby 2.0.0p353 and rails 4.1.4)
* Authentication using "Devise"
* Paging using "kaminiri"
* User Interface using "Bootstrap"
* Test cases using "RSpec, factory_girl_rails"

Installation and Run:

* Install dependency with "bundle install"

* Create database with "rake db:create"

* Migration with "rake db:migrate"

* Test with "rspec"
